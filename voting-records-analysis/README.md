Analysis of Voting Records
================

#### Data cleaning, analysis in R

My [analysis of Georgia voting data](https://github.com/ryanelittle/work_samples/blob/main/voting-records-analysis/georgia-analysis.Rmd) showed shows that the number of voters disenfranchised by rejected mail ballot applications skyrocketed after the GOP-controlled legislature passed sweeping new restrictions on mail voting last year. During municipal elections in November, Georgia voters were 45 times more likely to have their mail ballot applications rejected—and ultimately not vote as a result—than in 2020.

The work was a deeper look at an analysis by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in November 2021 that found rejected mail ballot applications had quadrupled compared to 2020. Where AJC asked what the rejection rate was, Mother Jones asked how many voters wanted a ballot but did not get one because their request(s) were ultimately rejected by election officials. I was able to see if voters ultimately voted by mail or in-person by joining voter history to the absentee voter data.
