Analysis of Court Records
================

#### Journalistitic data analysis in R, for loops, logical data cleaning

Analysis of
[okaloosa-criminal-records-analysis.rmd](https://github.com/ryanelittle/work_samples/blob/main/data-analysis-in-r/okaloosa-criminal-records-analysis.Rmd)
led to the core findings of the Howard Center for Investigative
Journalismâ€™s story on the [criminalization of
homelessness](https://apnews.com/article/571a8646896ed0d12f3fe7ca3b1d064d).
It turned out the same trends identified here were true in other parts
of the country.

The data also revealed our lead character. Before I found Kenneth Ivan
Shultz III on the streets of Fort Walton Beach, Fla., I found the
homeless man on the top of this data analysis. The 71-year-old retiree
has spent one of every three nights in jail since he became homeless
nine years ago.

He was charged with trespassing 96 times. As of June 29, 2020, he had
spent 1,034 days in jail. He owed $41,311 in court costs.

This analysis also created a searchable database that informed my
on-the-ground reporting on a March reporting trip I was ordered home
early from because of the pandemic. The database allowed me to search
criminal histories as I met individual homeless people on the ground.
