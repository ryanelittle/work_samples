#### Using existing libraries to quickly code scripts, problem solve on deadline
These scripts were written as I first began implementing a more functional style into the procedural scripts I was writing to acquire the court data the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism used for its [summer story on evictions](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2020/09/02/cares-act-eviction-ban-confusion/5686217002/).

[Oklahoma-court-scraper.ipynb](https://github.com/ryanelittle/work_samples/blob/main/python-early-scripting/oklahoma-court-scraper.ipynb) scrapes the [Oklahoma State Courts Network](https://www.oscn.net/dockets/). In this form, it can be used to scrape all evictions cases in Tulsa and Oklahoma counties using the function oklahoma.scrapes_cases().

[Address-parser.ipynb](https://github.com/ryanelittle/work_samples/blob/main/python-early-scripting/address-parser.ipynb) was written to clean the defendant addresses scraped from six different counties. The step was instrumental to increasing the percentage of addresses that were successfully geocoded. This process allowed us to assign evictions to neighborhoods and join the counts with U.S. Census demographic information.
